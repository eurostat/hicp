# Introduction to the `hicp`-package
The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) is the key economic figure to measure inflation in the euro area.
The methodology underlying the HICP is documented in the HICP Methodological Manual ([Eurostat 2018](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/de/web/products-manuals-and-guidelines/-/ks-gq-17-015)).
Based on this manual, the hicp-package provides functions for data users to work with publicly available HICP price indices and weights (upper-level aggregation).
It also provides easy access to HICP data from Eurostat's public database.
Further details can be found in the package vignette. 

The `hicp`-functions are designed for the use with R's data.table package.
